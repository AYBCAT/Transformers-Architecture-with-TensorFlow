 Transformer Network  

This repository provides an educational implementation of the **Transformer architecture** using TensorFlow.  

## ðŸ“˜ In this notebook, we cover:
- Creating **positional encodings** to capture sequential relationships in data  
- Calculating **scaled dot-product self-attention** with word embeddings  
- Implementing **masked multi-head attention**  
- Building and training a **Transformer model** from scratch  

## ðŸ”Ž Architecture Overview
